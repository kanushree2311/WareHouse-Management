# WareHouse-Management System
Hi I made this project using OOPs with Java.

## About the project :
Warehouse Management System is a simple console based Java project using Object Oriented Programming. It gives user defined exceptions.
There is a menu with 4 options :
<ol>
<li>  Add New Item,
<li>  Display All Items,
<li>  New Customer Details, and
<li>  Exit
</ol>
The system will continue until the user enters 4 to exit the system. The system gives discount accordingly like if total price is less than 7000 
then final price is determined after giving discount of 15 %, if price between 7000 and 15000 the discount of 25% and if more then 15000 discount of 43%.
