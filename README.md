# WareHouse-Management System
Hi I made this project with OOPs using Java.

## About the project :
Warehouse Management System is a simple console based Java project using Object Oriented Programming. It gives user defined exceptions.
There is a menu with 4 options :
1 - Add New Item,
2 - Display All Items,
3 - New Customer Details, and
4 - Exit
The system will continue until the user enters 4 to exit the system. The system gives discount accordingly like if total price is less than 7000 
then final price is determined after giving discount of 15 %, if price between 7000 and 15000 the discount of 25% and if more then 15000 discount of 43%.

## Tech Stack used :
Object Oriented Programming with Java

## How the program works :
Firstly, it askes if You want simple text converted to speech or read aloud a file.
Secondly, it askes which voice would you like the text to be narrated, in Female or Male voice.
Thirdly, if you choose 'simple text' it will ask the message  to be converted to speech or if you choose 'file' it will ask for it's directory (location/path of the file).
Fourthly, the message will be spoken by your operating system in your chosen voice.
Lasty, it will ask if you want to continue or not.
